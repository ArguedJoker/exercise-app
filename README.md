## Brief

The brief provided for the project sets the following out as the overall objective:

> To create a CRUD application with the utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training

This means that the application that is to be created will perform create, read, update and delete (CRUD) functions. The project will demonstrate my mastery of the knowledge and skillset so far, in particular the following skillset learned from all core training modules:

* Project Management
* Databases
* Java SE
* Spring Boot
* Front-End Development
* Automated Testing
* Continuous Integration
* Cloud Fundamentals

## Project Scope (Additional Requirements)

The minimum requirements for the project were as follows:

* Jira board containing a full expansion for user stories, use cases and history of tasks needed to complete the project

* Clear documentation outlining clearly from the design phase. THis was to include the architecture to be used.

* A detailed risk assessment that outlines and addresses all risks from start to finish of the project

* A relational database must be used for persistent data storage (GCP Managed SQL Server)

* The project must result in a functional application created in an OOP language (JAVA)

* Application must meet requirements set in Kanban Board

* The application must have functioning front-end website and an integrated API

* Fully designed test suites must be created for the application and these also include autmomated tests for validation of the application

* Test coverage of the application of the back-end must provide consistent evidence indicating acceptable level of coverage

* All code is fully integrated into a Version Control System

* Code is built through a CI server

* Application is deployed to a cloud-based virtual Machine

## Technologies

The following project constraints are as follows in the table:

<details>

| Technology | Use     |
| ---------- |---------|
| Jira       | Kanban board, Task Management / Tracking|
| GCP Managed SQL Server| Database|
| Java | Programming Language, Back-end |
| HTML | Markup langauge, Front-End|
| CSS | Styling Sheet Language, Front-end|
| JavaScript | Scripting Language, Front-end|
| JUnit & Mockito | Unit Testing |
| Selenium | Integration Testing |
| Git | Version Control |
| CircleCI | CI Server |
| GCP Virtual Machine | Cloud Server |

## My Approach

In order to achieve this I decided on producing an application on a subject that is rather topical in the current economical climate and rather close to my heart in the following introduction:

### Project Introduction
<details>
<p align="justify">
In the current climate with everyone being stuck inside, exercise has never been more been at the forefront of peoples minds. This Web App will attempt to address the need for creative ideas, educational information and provide the user the ability create their own activities, update these activities and delete them if necessary.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In the initial stages this application will display CRUD principles only for the purpose of the scope of the marking for this project. I will be adding more functionality to it in an iterative manner as I develop my knowledge and techniques.
